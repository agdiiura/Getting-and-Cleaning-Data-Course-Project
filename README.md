# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

## Introduction
Peer Assessment Project for Getting and Cleaning Data. The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones, see http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## Script and the tidy dataset

This project includes a script called `<run_analysis.R>` which can be ran against the dataset that is available here. By default the data are in the directory `<./Dataset>`.

The output of the 5th step (mean and standard deviation of each measurement per subject and activity) is called `<tidy_dataset.txt>`, and uploaded in the course project's form. For further details see the Code Book in the `<CodeBook.md>` file.
